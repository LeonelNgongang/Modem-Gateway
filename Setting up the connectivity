Connecting to the PiloT via a UART port.
To enable handshaking on the serial port, enter the following commands:
      gpio –g mode 16 ALT3
      gpio –g mode 17 ALT3
You are now able to use AT commands to communicate with the HL module on the PiloT
For a full list of AT commands for the Sierra Wireless HL modules, visit the Source.

To use AT commands, open a Minicom session by entering the following:
    minicom –D /dev/ttyAMA0 
    Check the AT commands are working by typing ‘AT’ and pressing enter.
    This should return ‘OK’.
    Exit Minicom (Ctrl A then X > enter).

Connecting via USB

The USB interface provides several USB endpoints to the Raspberry Pi. These can be set using the AT+USBCOMP command.
Serial endpoints can be seen by typing the following:
    ls /dev/ttyACM*
 
A serial session over USB can be instigated using the command below:
    minicom –D /dev/ttyACM0
   
   For LED function activation, enter the following commands in minicom:
   To monitor network connections, use of the left LED is recommended. 
   To use the LED to indicate whether the PiloT is connected to the network, enter the following command:
   
    at+ksync=2,7
    
    To switch off the left LED, send:
    
    at+ksync=0
    
    To switch off the right LED, send:
    
    at+kgpio=8,0
    
 
Using IP
In Minicom, enter the following command, which changes the USB end points to provide a CDC ECM interface:

    AT+KUSBCOMP=2
Close Minicom (Ctrl A then X > enter), then power cycle the Raspberry Pi by removing and reinserting the power cable.


Configure the HL8 bearer APN by opening a Minicom session to /dev/ttyACM0, 
then entering the following command using the appropriate APN according to your selected network:

    AT+CGDCONT=1,“IP”,“Access Point Name”
    
 Configure the APN username and password: 
    
    AT+WPPP=1,1,“username”,“password”
    
 Configure dynamic DNS request:
      
      AT+XDNS=1,1
      
 To start an IP session:
 
    AT+XCEDATA=1,0
    
 To stop an IP session:
 
    AT+CGACT=0,1
